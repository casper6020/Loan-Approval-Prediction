**CIBIL Score (β = 0.0123, p < 0.001):**
*The positive and statistically significant coefficient suggests that a higher CIBIL score increases the log-odds of loan approval. This aligns with standard credit risk practices, where applicants with higher credit scores are    considered more creditworthy and thus more likely to be approved.*

**Loan Term (β = -0.1657, p < 0.001):**
*The negative coefficient implies that longer loan tenures reduce the log-odds of loan approval. Longer repayment periods often increase the lender’s risk exposure, as they are more uncertain and subject to future financial changes of the borrower. Therefore, this negative relationship is financially consistent.*

**Loan-to-Income Ratio (β = -1.4561, p < 0.001):**
*A higher loan-to-income ratio significantly reduces the likelihood of loan approval. This indicates that when the loan amount is large relative to income, the applicant is perceived as riskier, consistent with prudent credit assessment principles.*
